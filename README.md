The Last Stop game

The game was made in Scratch and the link to the game can be found at - https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/604536474/
Hope you enjoy the game.

Welcome to The Last Stop!
The last stop is a game you play with a friend or your partner (when you're on a first date and you're pretty nervous). It's a game which will help you break the ice in a fun way.

You start the game by rolling the dice and then a card is shown and whatever question is shown you have to ask your partner/friend, there are some tasks and some questions. Once you've done that, click on the card so it closes and the next player can roll the dice.
